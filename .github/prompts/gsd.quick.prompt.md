## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees (atomic commits, STATE.md tracking).

Quick mode is the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns gsd-planner (quick mode) + gsd-executor(s)
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md "Quick Tasks Completed" table (NOT ROADMAP.md)

**Default:** Skips research, plan-checker, verifier. Use when you know exactly what to do.

**`--full` flag:** Enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification. Use when you want quality guarantees without full milestone ceremony.

<execution_context>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS

Context files are resolved inside the workflow (`init quick`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks.
</context>

<process>
Execute the quick workflow from @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/quick.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, task description, planning, execution, state updates, commits).
</process>
